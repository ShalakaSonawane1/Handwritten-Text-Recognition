# **Handwritten Digit Recognition Using Deep Learning**  

## **Overview**  
Handwritten Digit Recognition is a challenging problem in machine learning and artificial intelligence due to the wide variation in handwriting styles. This project aims to develop a **Handwritten Digit Recognition System** using **Deep Learning (CNNs)** to convert handwritten digits into machine-readable formats.  

## **Problem Statement**  
Optical Character Recognition (OCR) is a well-known problem in AI, but challenges arise when dealing with ambiguous and highly varied handwritten text. Traditional OCR methods often fail to achieve high accuracy in such cases. Our project focuses on developing an effective and reliable approach for recognizing handwritten digits, ensuring **error-free banking operations, secure transactions, and improved automation** in various industries.  

## **Proposed Solution**  
Our system follows these steps:  
1. A character is written on a **blackboard or digital canvas**.  
2. A **bounding box** is created around the character.  
3. The **cropped image is sent to a trained deep learning model**.  
4. The model **predicts the character** using a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**.  
5. The **recognized digit is converted into text** and displayed.  

## **Use Cases**  
ðŸ”¹ **Banking & Financial Security** â€“ Detect fraudulent signatures in cheques and legal documents.  
ðŸ”¹ **Traffic & Vehicle Monitoring** â€“ Recognize  number plates for better security and surveillance.  
ðŸ”¹ **Smart Classroom Applications** â€“ Convert handwritten notes into digital text for automated grading.  
ðŸ”¹ **Automated Form Processing** â€“ Convert handwritten forms into digital records for government and corporate use.  

## **Technology Stack**  
| Component         | Technology Used  |
|------------------|-----------------|
| Model Training  | TensorFlow, Keras |
| Dataset         | MNIST Handwritten Digits |
| Backend        | Python (Flask/Django) |
| GUI Application | Tkinter, PyQt, Streamlit |

## **Model Architecture**  
We built and trained a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**, known for its **high accuracy in image classification tasks**. The CNN consists of:  
âœ” **Convolutional Layers** â€“ Extract features from the handwritten digits.  
âœ” **Pooling Layers** â€“ Reduce dimensionality while preserving important patterns.  
âœ” **Fully Connected Layers** â€“ Perform classification based on extracted features.
